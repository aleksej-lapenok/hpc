    "# BRIEF THEORY\n",
    "\n",
    "The Open MPI Project is an open source Message Passing Interface implementation that is\n",
    "developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application developers and computer science researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "MPI has a number of different \"send modes.\" These represent different choices of buffering (where is the data kept until it is received) and synchronization (when does a send complete). In the following, I use \"send buffer\" for the user-provided buffer to send. \n",
    "\n",
    "- MPI_Send\n",
    "  MPI_Send will not return until you can use the send buffer. It may or may not block (it is allowed to buffer, either on the sender or receiver side, or to wait for the matching receive).\n",
    "- MPI_Bsend \n",
    "  May buffer; returns immediately and you can use the send buffer. A late add-on to the MPI specification. Should be used only when absolutely necessary. \n",
    "- MPI_Ssend\n",
    "  will not return until matching receive posted\n",
    "- MPI_Rsend\n",
    "  May be used ONLY if matching receive already posted. User responsible for writing a correct program.\n",
    "-  MPI_Isend\n",
    "   Nonblocking send. But not necessarily asynchronous. You can NOT reuse the send buffer until either a successful, wait/test or you KNOW that the message has been received (see MPI_Request_free). Note also that while the I refers to immediate, there is no performance requirement on MPI_Isend. An immediate send must return to the user without requiring a matching receive at the destination. \n",
    "   \n",
    " An implementation is free to send the data to the destination before returning, as long as the send call does not block waiting for a matching receive. Different\n",
    "strategies of when to send the data offer different performance advantages and disadvantages that will depend on the application\n",
    "- MPI_Ibsend buffered nonblocking\n",
    "- MPI_Issend Synchronous nonblocking. Note that a Wait/Test will complete only when the matching receive is posted.\n",
    "- MPI_Irsend As with MPI_Rsend, but nonblocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \"nonblocking\" refers ONLY to whether the data buffer is available for reuse after the call. No part of the MPI specification, for example, mandates concurent operation of data transfers and computation."
